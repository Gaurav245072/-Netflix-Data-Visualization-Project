This project analyzes the Netflix dataset to explore insights about movies and TV shows.
I used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, process, and visualize the data.

The goal was to answer questions such as:

How are Netflix movies distributed by duration?

How has the number of releases changed over the years?

Which countries contribute the most content?

Whatâ€™s the trend between Movies vs. TV Shows?
